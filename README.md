# isabelle-stackelberg
Python code for solving Stackelberg Partially Observable Stochastic Games Under Onesideness Using the PBVI Algorithm


There are two ways to run the program

The test.ipynb notebook provides a comprehensive way to look at the functionality of the different classes in the library.

The test.py script can be used to run a single experiment of one game with a fixed gametype and horizon

run_experiments.py script runs an n number of games with all 3 gametypes and all solve modes, it uses arguments passed in the command line.
